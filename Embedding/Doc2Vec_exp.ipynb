      "MOST (48755, 0.6369550824165344): «wish we picked different set of play food these are not well crafted toys that will last you for few years my daughter is pretty gentle with her toys but the paint on the play food in this set was already coming off few weeks after opening it paint rubs off onto the other pieces of food chips off the food and the wood gets nicked easily our watermelon piece is especially trashed the paint has started coming off in chunks concern when we have baby crawling around our home too and there huge crack down the middle they are poor quality but cute and child sized perfect for child hands don get why other reviewers are complaining they want play food that realistically sized you want toy fish or steak or watermelon or milk carton that proportional ve never seen play food that not in child friendly mini version it wouldn even fit in child play kitchen otherwise if you are thinking of buying because of the made in usa standards the melissa and doug brand has proudly advertised for years don be most of their toys are made in china now»\n",

      "SECOND (15791, 0.6203740239143372): «we bought one just like this in target made for target and it has none of the problems listed on this product paint is still intact after many plays looks still like new and we have so much fun with it stacking and sorting colors making color piles then shape piles then stack by color by shape etc it has lots of uses to prevent boredom great toy yes you should be careful not to have in laying down in the middle of the room or someplace where your toddler can fall on it clean up after play and just have fun with this»\n",
